# TAHub User Guide

TAHub Level 3 (TAHub) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAHub can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

            - <span style="color: #ff7f0e;"><strong>Mac:</strong></span> Press `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit Enter.
            - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`, or search for "Terminal" in your applications menu.
        2. Once the terminal is open, type the following command and press Enter:
           ```bash
           java -version
           ```
        3. If your system has Java `17` or above, you should see something like:
           ```bash
           java version "17.0.x" 2024-xx-xx LTS
           ```
        4. If your Java version is lower than `17`, proceed to the next step to install Java.

    - **Install Java `17` if not installed:**
        1. Go to [Oracle's Java 17 download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
        2. Download and install the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) for your operating system by following the instructions provided.
        3. After installation, repeat the `java -version` command to ensure Java is properly installed.


    

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/TAHub-level3/releases).

    1. Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/se-edu/TAHub-level3/releases).

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

TAHub data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/TAHub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
